# HTTP listener. Always present, but what it does depends on whether TLS is
# configured:
#
#   no certificate - serves the application directly, since it is the only
#                    listener there is. The default posture for this milestone.
#   certificate    - serves nothing and redirects everything to HTTPS. Every
#                    API request carries an `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header
#                    (see client/src/services/api.js), so once an encrypted
#                    origin exists, continuing to answer on plaintext :80 would
#                    just be an alternate route for handing those tokens to
#                    anyone on the path.
